# Rust sentence generator

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "Rust sentence generator".

It's purpose is to analyze and generate natural language sentences using different algorithms and data structures.

## Idea

A library that uses natural language processing algorithms to analyze and generate sentences. The library should use a vector data structure to store the words and a Markov chain algorithm to generate sentences based on the probability of the next word. The library should also use a regex module to parse and tokenize the sentences and a Levenshtein distance algorithm to measure the similarity between two sentences.

## Learning

- Rust
- Vector
- Parsing
- Tokenize
- Markov chain algorithm
- Levenshtein distance algorithm

## Requirements

- A user must be able to add new sentences to analyze which are to be stored on the user's device.
- A user must be able to generate a complete random sentence.
- A user must be able to give the first words of a sentence and have the code finish it.
- A user must be able to give the last words of a sentence and have the code finish it.
- A user must be able to give 1 or more words to generate a sentence with.
